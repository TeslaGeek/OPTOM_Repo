Name: Michael Ditcher.
Address: Penthouse, Busytown Towers, 1, Main Road, Busytown EA17 1AA.
DOB: 30/11/1961.

Mr Ditcher attended a routine sight test today with no symptoms, although he did mention that occasionally his night vision is reduced. His general health seems fine, but he does tell me that he's being reviewed for sleep apnoea. There is a very strong history of glaucoma in the family with it being present on both sides.
Upon investigation, I notice that his right optic disc is very large, very deep, and although defined; I can see the lamina cribrosa.
His intraocular pressures today measured with Perkins tonometry at 5:20 are 22 in the right eye and 17 in the left. He has a repeatable field defect, an inferior arcuate in the right eye. Considering all his symptoms, I suspect he has normal tension glaucoma and would be grateful of your review of his case in turn.
