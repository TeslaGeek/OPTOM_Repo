Name: Lily Blunders.
Address: 7 Shanty Lane, Busytown EA17 3DL.
DOB: 01/06/2024.

Lily came to the practise today, having poked himself in the left eye five days ago. Since then, her parents have said that she's crying a lot and her eyes are both red and discharging. Given her age, I haven't been able to do many tests, but it does appear as though she has bacterial conjunctivitis. Given her very young age, I am reluctant to give chloramphenicol myself and would be grateful of an urgent ophthalmic.
