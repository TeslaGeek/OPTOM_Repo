Name: Lisa Bobbi.Address: Flat 11 The Caxton Centre, St Albans, AL3 6XT.DOB: 06/08/1969.Ms Bobbi attended the clinic today complaining of pain, headaches and glare around her right temple, mostly in the evenings. She has an under active thyroid and is taking several medicines. There is a family history of glaucoma (father). Upon investigation the intraocular pressure in the right eye was raised (26 mmHg, Goldmann @ 16.45). Pressure in the left eye was normal (10 mmHg, Goldmann @16.45). Disc cupping in the right eye was 0.8 and in the left eye 0.7. The anterior chamber was open in both eyes (Van Herrick grade 3), but there was significant field loss in the right eye (Henson 9000). I suspect glaucoma in the right eye and would be grateful for an urgent ophthalmological review given the discomfort and symptoms being experienced by Ms Bobbi. I have advised Ms Bobbi that she may have glaucoma in the right eye and said I would be referring her for further evaluation.
