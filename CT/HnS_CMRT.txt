Please help me, my eye is so painful!
This morning I was putting in my contact lenses an I don't know how but I accidentally wetted the contact lens for my left eye with soy sauce rather than the proper solution.

It's so painful I can't take the contact lens out.
Oh I'm so sorry, I left my glasses at home. I was in such a panic to get here this morning. Please help me as quickly as you possibly can.

Yes, I do drive. I drove here this morning actually, just with my contact lenses in.

My occupation I'm a speech therapist. I don't really have any hobbies to talk about. Please can we move on and fix my eye?

My vision, well, my vision is actually obviously not as clear as it's supposed to be, because of how painful my left eye is. But before I put my contact lenses in, it was pretty good.

My general health is fine, I don't take any medicines. 
My doctor is Doctor Haricot, Old school Surgery, Elephant Lane, Busy town EA17 4NQ.

I've never had any other problem with my contact lenses or my eyes in the past. There's no family history of any problems, but please let's hurry along; my eye is so painful!

I don't have anything else to tell you, please let's hurry along. My eye is so sore! I just want this sorted out as quickly as possible.
