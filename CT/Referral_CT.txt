Name: Cinderella Tagliatelle.
Address: 37 Boulevard-de-Nantwich, Busytown EA17 1AX.
DOB: 05/05/1994.

Cinderella attended my practise this morning complaining of an extremely uncomfortable, painful and red left eye. This is as a result of putting her contact lenses in which she had soaked in soy sauce rather than contact lens solution. Her vision is slightly reduced, but since she drove to the appointment today I've been unable to make many measurements. I suspect that she is suffering from epithelial sloughing as a result of chemical trauma and would be grateful of your second opinion on her case. She is extremely photophobic which is made assessing her fundus very difficult, although I suspect there is nothing wrong. She has significant corneal staining with fluorescein both with and without the contact lenses in. I have suggested that Cinderella uses preservative free carbomer gel to soothe her symptoms and not to wear her contact lenses until she has been reviewed.
Given the severity of her corneal staining and the sudden onset of her symptoms, I would be grateful of her review as an emergency case.
