Name: Eloise Voght.
Address: 39 Rue d'Escaliers, Busytown EA17 9QB.
DOB: 01/09/1995.

Eloise attended a sight test today complaining of headaches for the last month. She mentions that her vision is reduced and comes and goes, feeling dim sometimes and missing in the middle. She notices this more in her left eye rather than the right, and both eyes are painful, particularly when looking around. She's been feeling under the weather for quite some time and I notice from her general health that she has atopy.
Her fundus appears generally healthy, although I notice that her optic nerve heads are swollen, particularly more on the left than the right. I did not see venous pulsation, but I suspect given her combination of symptoms and my findings, that she is suffering from Optic neuritis. I notice also that she has a red colour vision defect. Her visual fields show a centrocaecal defect, which again supports this diagnosis.
I will be grateful of your prompt review of her case within the next two weeks. She may also require referral onwards to investigate systemic causes of these problems.
